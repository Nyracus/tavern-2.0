**`Testing`**  
`The task is very simple`  
`Write Unit test and integrate it with your 470 project 🙂`

`Testing is a very essential part of developing a project. In this assignment, we will only focus on the very ground level of testing, which is unit testing.`

`We will use frameworks for testing purpose. Like Jest for Javascript/Typescript/Nodejs, Pytest for FastAPI, Phpunit/Pest for php.`

`Details:`  
`There will be a folder named “tests” in your backend directory and you will write your test codes in that directory. Each member of the team will create one test file and write his/her test codes inside that`  
`For jest, the file structure will be like:`

`src`  
`|`  
`|-tests`  
	`|-{member_1_id}_{feature_name}.test.ts`  
	`|-{member_2_id}_{feature_name}.test.ts`  
	`|-{member_3_id}_{feature_name}.test.ts`

`Each member will write test codes for only one feature that he/she has developed. And he/she has to write test codes for all the API endpoints used in that feature. For example, say one of the features of member_1 of the team is blog, which includes showing, creating, updating and deleting blogs. Say, there are 4 API endpoints used for the CRUD purposes. That member needs to write at least 4 unit tests to check all 4 endpoints. While writing the test codes, authentication must be handled properly (no hardcoded token/access-entries are allowed)`  
`Automate the process (Optional):`

- `Say when you commit your code, add running tests as a precondition for committing successfully`
